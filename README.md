Follow these instructions in order to successfully execute this simple task. **Make a commit after completion of each point, this is very important as it would be seen whether you have commmited after each stage or not**.
1. Create a folder with the name as your enrollment ID, eg, IIT2020XXX. **No need to commit at this stage as the folder is empty.**
2. Create a file named "aboutme.md" inside the folder you created in step 2. As it is a markdown file, make sure to use the markdown format as you like. There would be 4 sections in the file which are mentioned in points below.
3. **Section 1** : Your personal details i.e. Your name, Enrolment ID & Branch.
4. **Section 2** : A personalised answer to the question : "Why you want to join the FOSS wing?".
5. **Section 3** : A personalised answer to the question : "What technologies have you worked on in the past?".
6. **Section 4** : Mention all the projects created by you individually or in a group with GitHub Repository links in this section.
